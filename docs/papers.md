# Research Papers

Research on social media is moving fast, both in terms of the research questions and the methods used to answer them.
The best way to keep up with the latest research is to read the research papers.
Here, we maintain a list of research papers that are relevant to the core topics of this course.

The papers are organized by different topics.

For papers that are published and publicly available, we provide the link to the paper.
For those behind a paywall, we provide the links to the preprint or the author's website.
